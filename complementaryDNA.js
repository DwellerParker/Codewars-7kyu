// In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

function DNAStrand(dna){
    let arr = dna.split("");
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length;i++){
      if(arr[i] === "A"){
      arr[i] = "T"
    }else if (arr[i]=== "T" ){
      arr[i] = "A"
    } else if (arr[i] === "C"){
      arr[i] = "G"
    }else {
      arr[i] ="C"
